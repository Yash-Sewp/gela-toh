It began its operations in 2015 focusing cakes for various events. The ice cream business started in 2021 and has been growing steadily ever since. GelaToh is the first company to manufacture and supply its own branded alcoholic ice cream. GelaToh has created a product that unites two of life's greatest pleasures which taste as flavourful and smooth as our favourite crème liqueur cocktails. The magical union of top-shelf crème liqueurs and premium ice cream is a taste of experience without compromise. Whether you lean into alcohol or dessert, PROOF meets you where you are, defying lifestyles, interests, cultures, and ages. If you're 21 years or older, it's a spoon, pint, or frozen sip of sophisticated indulgence. Our primary mission is to expand and distribute our crème liqueur ice cream product nationwide to all retailers, and high-end nightclubs and restaurants."></app-title>
